Game description:
- We are planning to create a simple adventure game.- 
- There are three difficulty levels in total, "Easy", "Normal", "Hard".
- Every player gets 100% Strength at the beginning.
- There will be some hearts(to gain strength) and some obstacles(to loss strength).
- The player should try their best to catch the hearts and avoid the obstacles.
- Once the strength of player turns 0, the game will end and the player will lose.

//

Level:
For "Easy", the hearts and obstacles will come out regularly with the same frequency. Every heart can give +10 strength and every obstacles may cost -10 strength.

For "Normal", the frequency of having obstacles will be larger than the frequency of having hearts. Every heart may give +0/+10/+20 strength and every obstacles may cost -10 strength.

For "Hard", an object will come out without showing that it is heart or obstacles. Every time catching the object may randomly increase or decrease the strength.

//

Win: Passing all three levels 
- Number of hearts and obstacles will be recorded. Best result will be calculated by subtracting the number of obstacles to the number of hearts

// 

List of features that we plan to implement:
- The obstacle and the hearts will appear randomly, which matches with the coding requirement 1. 
- Separate in three files for three levels and the structure of the game
