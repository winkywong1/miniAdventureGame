Game description:

We are planning to create a simple adventure game.-
There are three difficulty levels in total, "Easy", "Normal", "Hard".
Every player gets 100% Strength at the beginning.
There will be some challenges for players to solve.
The player should choose different decision during each challenge
Each decision will bring different outcomes.

//
At the beginning of the game, the player will choose from 3 paths, wooden huts and lake. 
If they choose wooden huts, they will hear a child crying. They can choose comfort him or not. If they choose to comfort her, the child will be happy and give the player a steak. 
If not, the child will feel annoyed and the players will be deducted 20 cp value
If they choose lake, they have to play rock-paper-scissors with a fairy. They need to win the fairy to get a fish. Otherwise, they cannot get anything food from the fairy

After this forked road, the player will have to encounter a wolf. 
If the player obtains steak in the previous session, they can give the wolf steak. Then they can be safe. Then they have to choose between apple and banana.
If they choose apple, they can obtain the key but if they choose the banana, they will not obtain the key and will lose 20 cp value. Then the player will arrive at the castle

When the player has no steak to feed the wolf, they have to choose the ways to defend. If they choose to defend the wolf using stick, their cp value will be reduced by 10. If they choose not to defend , they will lose 30 cp value. 
After the wolf, they will face the little red riding hood. They can choose to thank the little red riding hood or not. 
If they choose to do so, they can gain 20 cp value. Otherwise, 20 cp value will be deducted and an apple will fall down from the trees. If the player choose to eat, they can obtain the key but if not, they will still get the key when the apple is broken
No matter how the player treat the apple, they can get the key. 

Then the player enter the castle. There will be a dog in front of the castle. If the player has the key, he can enter the castle. 

After entering the castle, the player will have to face a ghost. The ghost will ask him to choose a number. 
If the player choose odd number, his cp value will be lowered by 30. 
If the player choose even number, the ghost will ask the player for making friends. 
If the player permit, nothing will be lost. 
If not, the ghost will be angry and 10 cp value will be deducted. 
No matter how the ghost respond, the player can proceed forward to the room keeping the dog
If the player now have the ghost as a friend, he can call the ghost to open the door for him
If not, he can also choose to hit the door, but this action will cost a 20 reduction in CP value. 
Otherwise, if the player choose to give up, he fails and the game will end. 
If he does not choose to give up, the last task is to remember the dogs name. 
If he successfully guess the name, he wins the game. 
Otherwise, he loses the game. 

Back to the castle entrance.
If he does not have the key, he can choose to play a game to obtain the key. 
If he choose not to play the game, he loses and the game end. 
If he choose to play the game, he needs to guess a word
If he can guess the word correctly, he can get the key. 
Otherwise, he will lose the game.

List of features that we plan to implement:

The rock-paper-scissors will appear randomly, matching with coding requirement 1. 
Separate in three files for three levels and the structure of the game
We will have a file for the obstables, a file for hearts, a file for the players and a file for the adventure, which fulfils the requirement 4 and 5.
There will be files to loading the game status, calculate the marks of the player, choose the difficulties etc, which fulfils the requirement 4.
The game status will be stored in arrays to let the storage be more organized, which is the requirment 2.
