Welcome to the restaurant
In this restaurant, you will have the chance to replenish your cp value
You will play a game and your performance of this game will determine the gain in cp value
First we will receive a card, which is not shown to you at this moment.
There are 25 numbers on the card, arranging in a 5 x 5 manner.
The number will not be greater than 100 and smaller than 1
The numbers are randomly assigned
You have to write 5 groups of number, each group contains 2 numbers
That means there are total 10 numbers
The number should be within 1-100 (including 1 and 100)
In each group, the two number, the sum of the two number,
the difference of the two number and the sum of the sum and the difference of two numbers will be written on another card.
If the number on our card is the same as any number on your card, we will set this number to 0 on our card.
