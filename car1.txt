Welcome to the volcano land.
This is a wonderful land but it has 5 holes.
Your mission is to pass all the holes.
If you want to jump, press certain times of 'a' and then press Enter.
YOu just need to make the decision on how many jump you will have.
If you fail to jump in anyone of the 5 holes, you will lose the game.
You need to make the jumping decision before you start running
For example, if you want to jump for 3 times during the running, you just need to press aaa and the press Enter before you start running
For example, if you press aabaa, you will lose the game
Ready? The game will start soon
